# Google-translate-like-application-using-tkinter
A python mini-project done during my 4th semester.
The Google Translate-like application is a user-friendly language translation tool built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and TextBlob for text translation. The project aims to provide an intuitive platform for users to seamlessly translate text between various languages. In an increasingly interconnected world, effective communication across linguistic boundaries is crucial, and this application endeavors to bridge that gap.
